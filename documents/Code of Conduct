# Software Engineering Methods Code of Conduct

## Purpose of the COD
The SEM community is very dedicated to creating a welcoming and inclusive atmosphere for every participant. This Code of Conduct articulates our behavioural expectations, laying the groundwork for a positive and collaborative learning environment that benefits all involved.

## Primary Principles

•	Collaboration. Try to always encourage collaboration as well as communication between individuals. Share your knowledge and insights as it will enhance the learning experience for everyone involved.

•	Inclusivity. Embrace and appreciate other peoples differences when it comes to ideas, background and experiences as everyone will have a different outlook. Make sure to create an environment where everyone feels welcomed and included.

•	Respect. Make sure to treat everyone with respect and dignity. By respecting everyone’s perspective the community is a more diverse and inclusive community.

•	Professionalism.  Always maintain a degree of professionalism and make sure to uphold ethical standards and academic integrity.

•	Constructive Feedback. Provide any feedback in a constructive manner and focus on solutions rather than personal criticism.

•	Safety. Ensure the safety of every participant and work together to address any concerns within the group.

## Unacceptable Behaviour

•	Disruptive Behaviour. Any behaviour that disrupts other individuals or impacts their learning is not allowed.

•	Discrimination. Discrimination based on race, gender, sexuality or religion as well as any other aspect is unacceptable.

•	Harassment. Harassment in the form of intimidation, offensive comments or bullying is also not tolerated.

•	Plagiarism. Submitting work that has not been completed by the involved individuals without the proper attribution is also not allowed within SEM.



## Consequences

Violations of this Code of Conduct may result in consequences, which can include:

•	A Warning. A formal notice indicating the violation and the need for corrective action.

•	Probation. A temporary status during which an individual is closely monitored, and further violations may result in more severe consequences.

•	Suspension. Temporary removal from the program or community, with the possibility of reinstatement after a specified period and meeting certain conditions.

•	Expulsion. Permanent removal from the program or community without the option for a return
